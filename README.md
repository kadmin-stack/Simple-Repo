# Welcome to my simple repo
Hoping this code is useful if you find it here.\
Don't expect anything spectacular but it should be practical.
At least for now, I like using Bash, Powershell, Javascript (and it's variants - Google Apps Script, NPM, etc.), and Python for their portability, and, because I'm a beginner. 
And, since I'm a lifelong learner I look forward to improving). And, discovering a lot of other code. Logic is Logic.

I could say "All rights reserved." and it would be true - but, honestly this code is probably subpar anyway. Yet, who wants to give away their rights? Not me and, probably, not you.
The saying of "Sharing is Caring" is true and doesn't preclude boundaries ;) \
Well, enjoy and hope you make whatever you're making better by seeing how NOT to do it :D
